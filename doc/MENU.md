# MENU from dials

Three dials are reserved for specific purposes:

## Patch dial

![](../media/MENU-Patch.png)

You select a specific patch stored in the XFM2 memory banks with the Patch dial. After selecting a patch, you activate this patch by pressing the patch-dial.

## Param dial

With the param-dial, you select a menu item, and with the data-dial you change or select the corresponding menu item value.

### Init

The first menu-option is the initialization of the XFM2 synthesizer. Because this is the first item, clicking on the Data-dial will automatically initialize the synthesizer.

### Algorithm

![](../media/Algorithm.png)

For those that are "hooked" to the original 32 algorithms of the DX7, you can use this menu-option to select a specific algorithm. Note that you can still change every operator routing manually! It is just a quick way of selecting an algorithm to get you started. But don't be afraid to boldly go where no FM synth has gone before!
