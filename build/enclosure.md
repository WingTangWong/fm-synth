# Enclosure

For the enclosure we use a [TEKO 364.8 enclosure](teko-3648.pdf).

On the left side of the enclosure, we will have three sockets:
- A mini USB socket for the XFM2;
- A mini stereo jack socket for the audio-out;
- A mini USB socket for the Teensy.

We need 60 + 5 + 50 = 115 mm space to house the PCB's on which these sockets are placed, to that's OK.

On the back side of the enclosure, we will also have three sockets:
- A MIDI out socket, connected to the XFM2;
- A dual mono-jack socket, connected to the DAC;
- A power socket, connected to the power PCB.

In normal operation, you only use the back sockets, in prototyping situation, you only use the side sockets.
